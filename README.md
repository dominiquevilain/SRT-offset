#SRT Offset

A small, quickly done, helper script i use to shift timecodes in srt files.

srt files are used to create subtitles for video files.

This script asks you to provide an offset in milliseconds and a sign (+ or -), in order to shift the timecodes used in the original file. It displays the result in the browser. You have to copy it in a new srt file in order to use it.
